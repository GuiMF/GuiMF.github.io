 <div class="about-content">
  <p>Hello my name is Guilherme and I am learning to program!</p>
  <p>At the tip of Europe, facing the North Antlantic Ocean in portugal, I was born. I was born from a portugese family and quickly picked up English. I loved Mickey mouse and still do making him a great influence in my life. I was alway very curious and wanted to learn something new, I used to watch science videos and really liked maths. Then one day we had to do a little bit of html in I.C.T class, only to find out that I would fall in love with programing. Essentially programing is a computer science and I love science, so I lernt programing.  </p>
