   <p>
     So... Today I felt like doing something to do with Mark Down sooooooo, I went to the Internet to watch a Mark Down crash course and I learned somethings like... Making things Italic,bold, Inserting images and doing more things.
     So... Know I will actualy write about my day. My day started out by waking up changing somethings in my Global Prespectives work then I had my breakfast, got dressed, huried to the car, talked to my dad on the way to school, listened to "milkar" which is this funny man who plays one the radio everyday (nearly everyday). Then we arrived I grab my bag which probably weighs a ton and start walking to school. When I get down to were we have your form classroom and greet Mikhail and Jake whom are most probably on there phone listening to music. Then I wait for the school bell to ring. We started the day with maths, in maths we learnt about angles. Then comes break were we spend it just bottle flipping. Then comes portugese or how our class likes to call it "pork and cheese"... Get it portugese, pork and cheeese ah? Okey carring on so it was 45 minuts of portugese and 45 minuts of english which makes an 130 minute lesson which is a full period. After came lunch which me and David played "Magic The Gathering" (MTG). After we hade english again but this time we whatched a video about "World War One" (WW1) and read our books. Finally came break which nearly everyone used to study for the french test and to do their homework. Then french lesson comes and miss makes us answer a few questions to see if we studied, which left us with no time to do the actual french test. So that was my school day

   <h3>Wednesday 28 November 2018</h3>
   <p>So... I'm writing about my day again that's right, writing about my day...
   So my day started this morning when I woke up and started talking with my dad, then silence happened, my dad asked me "were do you want to go on the Christmas break?" and I responded "I want to surf the Barrinha".
   "Without being that what do you want? Do you want to go snowboard at Sierra Nevada?" Asked my dad, so I responded "of course I do! I just thought you didn't like snow?"
   Then he said "we might go if you can convince your mum."
   So I put my clothes on and rushed down stairs to have my breakfast and to convince my mum.
   After I noticed that the my dad was ready to go to and I haven't even brushed my teeth! I quickly went upstairs to brush my teeth and left the house. On the way to school we listened to milkar as usual, laughed our brains out and arrived at school.  My bag was lighter than usual so it was no challenge to put it. I walked downstairs to our form classroom and saw and greeted Mikhail and Jake who were as usual on there phones listening to music. So I waited for the bell to ring as usual but! today there was a twist, everyone exept for David and I went on a school trip. That ment that David and I had special lessons were we use them to play "Magic" (I won the game of "Magic") and to watch videos about WW2.
   At break time we played "Bad Ice-cream" which is a one or two player game. After we had drama club, at drama clube I have a role as a character but I can't tell you all about it because it is secret (shhhhhh!). So I spent a lot of the time playing with another Guilherme, trying to imitate animals and imaginating things.<br>
   So at lunch time all the people from the class arrive and we told them how we are going to have "secret santa". "Secret santa" is basically a gift exchange where you write and fold all your classmate's name into separate pieces of paper and then put them into a hat. Each person takes a pieces of paper out and has to buy that person a gift with a price of around 10â‚¬. So after all the writing we waited until science lesson to get everyone together for the picking. We picked out a person. Wait, just guess who I got... I got Tom, I don't really mind because he is not very picky about what he gets and what he doesn't get.<br>
   So at last break I played marbles with Sofia N., David and I.
   At geography we watched two presentations, one from Ainoa, Dasha and Franscisca, and the other one was from Sofia C., Diana Z. and Diana S.. The one I thought was the best was the one from Sofia C., Diana Z. and Diana S., it talked about the Horn of Africa. Kyra was drawing on Emas hand and they got in detention because of that. So after the school ended and my dad went to pick me up. We went to the office and there he showed me the lights on the ceiling and how he could change the colour of them. Then I told him about article 13 and how it will change the internet in the EU. Then I just watched some videos. When we got home my mum suprised me with some new Vans but unfortunly they were to small for me so I can't wear them just yet! After I studied for portuguese and wrote some of this text you are reading now. Then I ate dinner which was fish pasta. And now I am writing this text. So this was my day and I hope you enjoied it. Bye!

 <h3>Thursday 29 November</h3>
 <p>Hello today I will be doing a quick summary of my day, lets get started!
 Today I woke up and went to my room to get dressed but then got stuck staring out the window looking at the pretty view, I could't see the ocean in fact all I could see was the city and the clouds covering the ocean.
 Then I got dressed and went downstairs to eat my breakfast but my breakfast was not done yet so I went down stairs to go check on my surf board.
 so we left the house and were on the way to school, milkar played on the radio as usual and we got as usual. I went to downstairs to our form classroom. Mikhail and Jake were watchig funny videos as usual but there was a twist today everyone from my portuguese group is studing for the exam, fliping through pages and trying to memorize everything as quickly as possible!
 So we go into the classroom and sit down, our very nice teacher gives us our exams an we begin. The exam went well for me because I took my time but we still don't know our results because we did them today. After it was break, were I had a great fall and hurt my leg. Then we had french were we lernt things. Then was lunch break were I just sat and talked with the girls.<br>
 After there was the english lesson were miss sent me out for talking when I didn't talk. So after we had history lesson but miss was sick so we just did homework for the whole lesson which ment no homework. Then was break were we played fussball. Then we finished history and went to music which was boring as usual Then I went to the supermarket and got home were I took a bath and watched "youtube" after I finally ate dinner (I was hungry). And now I am writing this text, hope you enjoied, Bye!

<h3>saturday 1 December</h3>
<p>yes I am writing about my day and yes I did not write about my day yesterday because I had no energy to write, at night I write like a word per minute, okey now to my day.
So I woke up and went downstaires to watch some videos, I found out what "Princess ruberts tears" are at least I Think Thats there name, anyway then I went to have my breakfast which was a cup of chocolate milk after I went up stairs to draw but then I just started the second step of my drawing I had been working on. Then my mum left the house and I went to study science.<br>
Finally we left the house to go cycling. So we went to my grammas house to get the bikes. I sat on my bike and rode down the road to Quarteira with my dad we went to the end of the path to see the sea, my gramma was there we greeted her and went on to go to the Falesia beach were I was going to surf that afternoon. on our way there we passed the fish market in Quarteira, went through the marina, passed my sailing club were I also greeted Gustavo which is a friend of mine.
Finally we made it to the beach were we saw the waves, they were fun, but like really fun. We stayed there for a while but then my hunger kicked in, we had to go eat some were and I knew were that some were was. My dad and I hopped on to the bikes and cycled to this very good restarunt in the marina called "Nosolo".
At "Nosolo" I ate an amazing pizza. But half way through our lunch an unexpected visiter came it was...
A bird, how wonderful it was a bird that came to us plus he was very close to us my dad even gave him a piece of crust from my pizza. We saw him eat it the crust was way to big, but he ate it anyway it was a very nice lunch I had today.<br>
After I went to the boat and got a hotter jacket because the jacket I was wering was not very hot. After that we left the boat and cycled back to my grammas house we we left the bikes.
After I went to my surf lesson were we had an amzing Idea to go tandom skating, there was only one problem Jack is a "regular" footer and I am a "goofy" footer which means I face the left while faces he the right. After all that carver nonsense we actually surfed and we (Tomas, Martime, luckas, jack, and I) Had a blast the waves were not to big nethier to small they were just right. I had an amazing wave were I locked right in and I also had a huge wipeout were I did the splits then I got slamed face-first then my face actually griped to the water which made me somersalt once. Martime and I got out of the water a little late which made us have to do a little more push-ups then the people who got out one time. After on our way to the surf club Martime statred getting a little hurt of the board because it was so heave, so I ofered to bring his board and he would breing mine because how mine is fiberglass it is lightre than the foam ones.<br>
After we got to the chinese restarunt for dinner there I ate a nice plate of chicken and noodles.
So that was my day hope you enjoyed and, BYE!
